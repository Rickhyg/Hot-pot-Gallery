<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Chongqing hot pot, also known as spicy hot pot. The chief characteristic of Chongqing hot pot is a numbing, spicy flavor.</p>

<h4>History</h4>
<p>The history of Chongqing hot pot started in the 1920s in Jiangbei District in Chongqing. In the beginning, the peddlers who worked on the wharf at the time would buy beef tripe, clean and boil it, and then cut beef liver and stomach into small pieces, and place it all into a clay stove. The stove used an iron basin to divide the stove into different sections that separated ingredients with different taste. When the spicy and salty soup boiled, the laborers would begin to eat, each person choosing their own food and own area divided in the stove, so they only eat and pay for what they put in that division, which is cheaper. It was not until the 23rd year of the Republic of China that a small restaurant in Chongqing turned the hot pot into a high-grade dish; before that, there was no restaurant that served Chongqing hot pot.</p>

<h4>Cooking and eating method</h4>
<p>As one of the most spicy types of hot pot, Chongqing hot pot uses different ingredients when making the hot pot base. The spicy Chongqing hot pot base is mainly red chili oil, which is made with beef fat and different kinds of spices, such as bay leaf, clove, cinnamon and so on.</p>
