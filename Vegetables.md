<h4>How to Cook with Chinese Cabbage</h4>
<p>Cabbage can be eaten raw in salads or boiled in soups. Cabbage has a high water content and when cooked it has a sweet and juicy taste, and it also absorbs other flavors from the food it was cooked with. Because it softens quickly, it is often added to stir-fries and soups at the end of cooking.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Glebionis coronaria, formerly known as Chrysanthemum coronarium, is a daisy-family flowering plant. Many Asian cuisines use green vegetables from this plant. They turn up in stews, casseroles and hot POTS in Cantonese and Hong Kong cuisine. The leaves are also an important ingredient in Taiwanese oyster omelets, which, while still tender, are used with the stems for soups and stir-fries.</p>
<p>In edible parts, the plant is high in minerals and vitamins, with potassium concentrations of 610 mg/100 g and carotene concentrations of 3.4 g/100 g. Furthermore, the plant includes antioxidants (in stem, leaf, and root tissues) that may have long-term health advantages for humans, while harmful (dioxin) qualities have also been detected.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Spinach is a widely used green vegetable that may be found in practically every cuisine on the planet.

The bitter flavor is distinctive - you either love it or you don't â€“ and goes well with dairy and eggs.</p>
<p>Younger, gentler leaves can be eaten raw in salads, whereas older leaves are frequently cooked (spinach has one of the shortest cooking times of all vegetables). During cooking, it shrinks drastically; a 450g bag will only feed two people.</p>

<h4>How to cook with winter melon</h4>
<p>
When preparing winter melon, remove the peel and seeds, as well as the soft flesh that retains the seeds. After cubing or slicing the firmer white meat, it can be steamed, simmered, braised, or parboiled and added to stir-fries.

</p>
<p>
Winter melon is best utilized in soups since it can absorb the flavors of the other components. It also be used in desserts, and it is frequently sliced and candied.

<p style="text-align: center">Created by wizdata <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en">CC0 1.0</a></p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Kombu is high in glutamic acid, an amino acid that gives food its umami flavor. And Iodine levels in Kombu are unusually high. While this element is required for regular growth and development, high dosages of kombu have been linked to thyroid problems in people who consumed significant volumes of soy milk containing kombu as an addition.</p>
<p>Kombu is also a good source of fiber. Algae, especially kombu, possess entire families of obscure enzymes that break down complex sugars that are generally indigestible by the human gut (therefore generating gas), such as the well-studied alpha-galactosidase and beta-galactosidase.</p>
