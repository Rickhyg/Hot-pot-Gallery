<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Sukiyaki is a beef and vegetable meal served in a nabemono (one-pot) style in Japanese cuisine. It's a relatively new addition to Japanese cooking. Because Buddhist law prohibited the slaughter of quadrupeds for nourishment, beef did not enter the Japanese diet until the 1860s, when continuous contact with the West began. Sukiyaki is made in a shallow iron pot over charcoal or similar portable heat source and served at the table. Thin beef slices are browned in oil, then topped with a sauce made of stock, soy sauce, and sugar. After that, tofu, shiitake mushrooms, onions, shirataki (a noodle-like dish), and vegetables are added and cooked quickly. Before eating, individual morsels can be dipped in beaten raw egg.</p>
