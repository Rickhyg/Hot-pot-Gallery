<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Ginger duck is a traditional duck dish in Taiwan. Most Taiwanese eat together when it is cold in winter.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the "imperial tonic ginger duck" industry combined with rice wine, sesame oil, and traditional Chinese medicine formula became the first taste of ginger duck in Taiwan. Since 1993, Taiwan ginger duck tastes even "counterattack mainland," affecting the original Chinese mainland Xiamen area ginger mother duck taste.</p>

<h4>History</h4>
<p>The origin of ginger duck is uncertain. It may come from the salt duck cooked in Quanzhou, China, and later spread to Xiamen and Taiwan. Before the Qing Dynasty, Quanzhou had cooked with Chinese herbal medicine and livestock. Xiamen Tong'an salt duck practice is like that of Xiamen ginger duck. Tong'an didn't belong to Xiamen until 1958. Before that, it belonged to Quanzhou, and Tong'an called salt duck ginger duck so that it may come from Quanzhou. But people in Quanzhou also say that it comes from Taiwan.</p>

<h4>Cooking and eating method</h4>
<p>Quanzhou and Taiwan ginger duck did not add sesame oil in the early years. In the 1980s, Taiwan producers added rice wine, sesame oil, and traditional Chinese medicine formula to become the prototype of ginger duck in Taiwan.</p>
