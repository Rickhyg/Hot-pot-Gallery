<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Budae-Jjigae, or army stew, is a dish that arose just after the Korean War, when food was limited and many Koreans were hungry. Food was smuggled in from American military bases, and local Koreans made a stew using the American components. The stew became a variety of Korean veggies, spicy seasonings, and other leftovers put together in a huge pot with processed meats such as spam and hot dogs. </p>
