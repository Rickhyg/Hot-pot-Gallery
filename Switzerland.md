<h4>History</h4>
<p>Fondue originated in 18th century Switzerland as a way for farm families to stretch their meager resources during the winter months. Fondue is derived from the French word "fondre," which means "to melt." The family may gather around the hearth with some leftover cheese, old bread, and a splash of wine. In alpine villages, bread is baked only occasionally, so the bread on hand is usually stale. But by dipping the bread in the melted cheese, it softens and becomes delicious. Fondue thus evolved from these humble beginnings to become a Swiss winter tradition.</p>
<p>The first written fondue recipes come in 18th century cookbooks produced in France and Belgium, but they ask for Gruyère, a cheese that is unmistakably Swiss, therefore the Swiss are justifiably credited as the inventors of fondue. Despite its rustic origins, fondue's popularity at the Swiss table was not limited to the farmhouse or the peasant class; rather, it was more commonly enjoyed by people of wealth. Fondue's broad popularity was a result of the Swiss Cheese Union's (Schweizerische Käseunion) push in the 1930s to encourage cheese consumption in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Swiss Cheese Union renewed its successful campaign after World War II and the end of rationing, now promoting fondue as the Swiss national dish and a symbol of Swiss unity and national identity. Fondue was also included in the Swiss military's cookbooks.</p>
