<h3>The History of Hotpot</h3>
<p>The origins of this communal cuisine are winding and disputed and it is not clear which place can truly claim to be the original home of the hotpot.</p>

<p>Anhui's claim to be the hometown of hotpot outraged devotees of the Sichuan and Chongqing varieties, who claimed ownership of the dish.</p>

<p>The first archaeological evidence may lend weight to their claims. Pots that date back nearly 2,000 years and may have been used to make an early iteration of the dish have been unearthed in the province.</p>

<p>The first references to the dish appeared in literature soon afterwards in texts that were written during the Three Kingdoms era.</p>

<p>"Its history is at least 1,700 years old," said Richard Zhang, the director of the Sichuan Cuisine Museum in Chengdu. "In the Three Kingdoms era [220-280], people cooked in copper pots, but it was not popular at that time. By the time of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, people used the hotpot to cook food gradually.</p>

<p>"At first, it was popular in the cold north of China, and people used it to cook all kinds of meat. Further developments in cooking technology led to the development of more variations of hotpot."</p>

<p>But others believe that the dish as we know it today probably has its roots in the 14th century.</p>

<p>Some accounts trace the roots of Beijing hotpot to the days of the Mongol empire around 800 years ago.</p>

<p>A legend from that time tells of a emperor impatiently waiting for his lamb leg to cook as he prepared for battle. His ingenious chef decided to speed up the process by chopping up the meat and boiling it, thereby giving rise to a new dish.</p>

<p>"In the Ming and Qing dynasties [from the late 14th century to early 20th century], some dignitaries liked hotpot very much, and they began to put different seasonings and ingredients into hotpots for the different flavours," said Zhou from the Beijing Cooking School. "Now, we have a lot of different ways to cook the different dishes."</p>

<p>The dish really began to take off in the early 19th century and the first appearance of what we would today recognise as Sichuan hotpot dates back to this era.</p>

<p>Its emergence is credited to the Yangtze River fisherman of the 1820s, who used to boil their meats in a communal spicy broth to keep warm and stretch their limited budgets as far as possible.</p>

<p>Some enterprising locals spotted an opportunity and began using giant communal pots to prepare the broth, introducing the dividers that many people use today to keep their ingredients separate from other diners' meals.</p>

<p>The first restaurant known to have served the dish appeared as late as the 1930s. Fittingly enough it opened in Chongqing, whose own variety of the dish is now flourishing across the globe.</p>
