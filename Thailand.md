<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Hotpot is known as Thai suki in Thai cuisine; however, it is not to be confused with sukiyaki, a Japanese shabu-shabu version. Originally a Chinese-style hot pot, the amount of available ingredients was substantially expanded, and a Thai-style dipping sauce with chili sauce, chilli, lime, and coriander leaves was added. Mu kratha, a Thai hot pot that developed from Korean BBQ and Thai suki, is another version. A similar technique of cooking known as chim chum is prevalent in the Northeast, where thinly sliced beef is cooked in clay pots on a charcoal stove. The soup base for Thai hot pot is Tom Yum.</p>
