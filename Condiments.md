Vinegar is commonly used in food preparation. It is an ingredient in sauces, such as hot sauce, mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Vinegar is sometimes used in chutneys. It is often used as a condiment on its own, or as a part of other condiments. Marinades often contain vinegar. Soups sometimes have vinegar added to them, as is the case with hot and sour soup. In terms of its shelf life, vinegar's acidic nature allows it to last indefinitely without the use of refrigeration.

Sesame oil made from seeds that have not been toasted is a pale-yellow liquid with a pleasant grain-like odor and somewhat nutty taste, used as frying oil. Oil made from pressed and toasted sesame seeds is amber-colored and aromatic, used as a flavoring agent in the final stages of cooking.
