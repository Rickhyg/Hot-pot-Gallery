<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Chaoshan hot pot originated in Shantou and was improved from the local "beef stove". The original "beef stove" used the soup mixed with Sha Cha sauce as the bottom of the pot, and then slowly boiled beef over charcoal fire, and then gradually developed into clear soup hot pot. The authentic Chaoshan beef hotpot pays attention to clear soup as the bottom of the soup. The common ones are clear soup or clear water boiled with beef bones and southern ginger.</p>

<h4>Cooking and eating method</h4>
<p>Beef hotpot in Chaoshan area generally selects cattle from Yunnan and Guizhou. Local stores will order live cattle from Yunnan Guizhou area and transport them to local breeding. When eating, pay attention to freshness and must be slaughtered on the day of eating. Frozen beef cannot be used. Beef is classified according to different parts of cattle, including "chest fat" (fat in front of cattle's chest), "fat callus" (a piece of meat on cattle's abdomen), "hanging dragon" (a long piece of meat on cattle's back), "neck kernel" (a small piece of meat protruding from cattle's shoulder blade), etc. The requirements for rinsing and ironing time of different parts are also different. For example, it only takes 8 seconds to blanch the dragon, while it takes 5 minutes to blanch the chest. Usually, only about 35% of a cow's body is suitable for direct scalding, and the beef in other parts will be made into hand beaten beef balls for boiling. When eating, it is usually dipped in sand tea sauce.</p>
